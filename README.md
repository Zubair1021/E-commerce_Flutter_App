# 🛒 E-commerce App - Tiers Limited Internship Project

This repository contains the code for my E-commerce app, developed as part of my internship at Tiers Limited. The app is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience with Firebase integration and proper form validation.

## ✨ Features

- 🔥 **Firebase Integration**: The app is connected to Firebase for authentication, database, and storage purposes.
- 🔑 **User Authentication**: Supports user sign-up, login, and password reset functionalities.
- 🛍️ **Product Management**: Users can browse, search, and filter products by categories.
- 🛒 **Cart Functionality**: Users can add products to their cart, view cart details, and proceed to checkout.
- 📦 **Order Processing**: Complete order processing workflow from cart to payment.
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Proper validation is implemented to ensure data integrity and user experience.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across different devices.

## ⚠️ Limitations

While the app covers the essential features of an e-commerce platform, there are a few limitations:

- 💳 **Payment Gateway**: Integration with a payment gateway is not included in this version.
- 📈 **Scalability**: The app is designed for small to medium-sized e-commerce stores and may require further optimization for larger scales.
- 🔧 **Limited Admin Features**: Currently, the admin panel has basic functionalities like product management and order tracking, but lacks advanced features such as analytics and reporting.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🎯 **Flutter**: For developing the cross-platform mobile app.
- 🔥 **Firebase**: For backend services including authentication, database, and storage.
- 🧑‍💻 **Dart**: The primary programming language used for Flutter development.
